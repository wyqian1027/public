Input: [1,2,3,4,5]<pre>
          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5   </pre> 
Output: [[4,5,3],[2],[1]]
 
Explanation:
1. Removing the leaves [4,5,3] would result in this tree:
<pre>          1
         / 
        2   </pre>       
2. Now removing the leaf [2] would result in this tree:
<pre>          1    </pre>      
3. Now removing the leaf [1] would result in the empty tree.
