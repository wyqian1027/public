1071. Greatest Common Divisor of Strings

For strings S and T, we say "T divides S" if and only if S = T + ... + T  (T concatenated with itself 1 or more times)

Return the largest string X such that X divides str1 and X divides str2.

Note:
1 <= str1.length <= 1000
1 <= str2.length <= 1000
str1[i] and str2[i] are English uppercase letters.
