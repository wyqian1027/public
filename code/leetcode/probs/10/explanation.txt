Basically, '.' replaces any letter; '*' can either duplicate a previous letter, or erase a previous letter if not match!

Top-down DP 2D.

dp[i,j] check if text[i:] matches with pattern[j:]

Specifically, at each i, j:

If next letter at j+1 is '*', then 
option 1: dp[i, j+2] &emsp; -> &emsp; erase the pattern at j
option 2: dp[i+1, j] &emsp; -> &emsp; ready to check next one maybe duplicate

If next letter at j+1 is not '*', then proceed normally with
only option: dp[i+1, j+1]
