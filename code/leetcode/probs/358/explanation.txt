Heap Solution: O(NlgN)
Use MaxHeap to store counts. 
1. Always popout the character with most counts. 
2. Then push to the Queue if counts != 0. 
3. Transfer all valid elements in the Queue to the MaxHeap.

Array Solution: O(26*N) = O(N), in reality it is slower...
Use two arrays. One is for counts; the other is for validity.
helper function gets the valid elements with greatest counts after index.
