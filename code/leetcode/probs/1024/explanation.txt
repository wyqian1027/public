Solution 1: DP 1D. 
For each instance of time, check any containing clip and update the result in the array.

Solution 2: Greedy.
end_left: left end of a current window
end_right: maximum right end from the clips that extends from end_left
The goal is to move end_left to the right to see if we can ever have a end_right that covers T, or if there is a hole (return -1).
