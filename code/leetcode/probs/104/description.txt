104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.
<span class="examples">
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  3
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  / \
&nbsp;&nbsp;  9  &nbsp;&nbsp;20
&nbsp;    /  \
   15 &nbsp;  7
return its depth = 3.
