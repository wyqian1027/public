28. Implement strStr()

Implement strStr().

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Clarification:
For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2

Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1
