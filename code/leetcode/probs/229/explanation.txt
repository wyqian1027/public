How O(N) Boyer-Moore works:

Do one of the following:
1. Increment counts if x is a candidate
2. Resetting candidates if x is not candidate and there are available slots ( count = 0 )
3. Decrementing counts for all candidates if x is not candidate and there are NO slots available ( all counts > 0 )

This can be generalized to k majority elements.

PS: Important! What we get is a list of high frequency candidates, whose counts are NOT necessarily more than n//3
