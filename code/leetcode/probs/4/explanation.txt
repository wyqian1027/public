Imagine there are two boards separating left part and right part of each array, A, B
<pre>
      left_part          |        right_part
A[0], A[1], ..., A[i-1]  |  A[i], A[i+1], ..., A[m-1]
B[0], B[1], ..., B[j-1]  |  B[j], B[j+1], ..., B[n-1]
</pre>
Our goal is to make sure:
1) len(left_part) == len(right_part)
2) max(left_part) <= min(right_part)

We let i = [0, m], so j = (m+n+1)//2 - i (ps. (m+n+1) is used to deal with odd sum of m+n)
Then we do binary search.
