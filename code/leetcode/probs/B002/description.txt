B002. Product of K consecutive numbers

Given an array of integers nums of size n, and an int k. Return an array result of size n such that result[i] = nums[max(0, i-k+1)] * ... * nums[i]. 

In other words, each element is the product formed from a sliding window of size k, possibly cut short by the left side of the array.

Input: nums = [1, 3, 3, 6, 5, 7, 0, -3], k = 3
Output: [1, 3, 9, 54, 90, 210, 0, 0]
Explanation: 1 (1), 3 (1x3), 9 (1x3x3), 54 (3x3x6), 90 (3x6x5), 210 (6x5x7), 0 (5x7x0), 0 (7x0x-3)
