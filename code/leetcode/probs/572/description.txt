572. Subtree of Another Tree

Given two non-empty binary trees s and t, check whether tree t has exactly the same structure and node values with a subtree of s. A subtree of s is a tree consists of a node in s and all of this node's descendants. The tree s could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

<span class="examples">
Given tree s:
<pre>     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \
 1   2</pre>
Given tree t:
<pre>   4 
  / \
 1   2</pre>
Return true, because t has the same structure and node values with a subtree of s.
