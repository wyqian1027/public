102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).
<span class="examples">
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  3
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  / \
&nbsp;&nbsp;  9  &nbsp;&nbsp;20
&nbsp;    /  \
   15 &nbsp;  7
return its level order traversal as:
[
  [3],
  [9,20],
  [15,7]
]
